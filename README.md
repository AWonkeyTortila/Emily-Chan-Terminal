# Emily-Chan-Terminal
This was my first ever program in C#, and quite frankly, my first ever coding project. It is very cringe to say the least, both the code and the content of the console.


The .exe is in the Bin/Degug/Net5.0/my-First-program.exe


================

To my future employer who is looking at this, I want to just say, that I wrote this code while learning a C#, in the middle of the night.
